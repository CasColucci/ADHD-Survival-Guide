# ADHD-Survival-Guide
My own survival guide for ADHD, though I hope it also helps some people out there struggling. Note that this guide does mention and discuss the use of AI to help deal with symptoms of ADHD like executive function, but many of these suggestions can be used independently of AI if there are any personal concerns you have.
