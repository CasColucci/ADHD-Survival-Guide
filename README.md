# ADHD-Survival-Guide
## Part 1: Introduction
Welcome to my ADHD Survival Guide. I'm Cas, aka Golly, and I have ADHD. I've struggled with it my whole life, though my diagnosis is only a few years old. I'm pretty familiar with the difficulties that come with trying to make real improvements in your life, and falling short. I'm also very familiar with the sense that nothing will ever change for the better. I'm more recently acquainted with the feeling that things actually can. 

So what's this guide? Is it going to be another tutorial for a system that'll fall apart within days? No, it's meant to be more of a guide for self-reflection. To help you take your favorite, most well-intentioned systems and make them actually work for you. I'm not here to peddle any 10 step system to a perfect life, you almost certainly have found those before. No new journals or planners here. I'm here to help you understand and reconsider the areas that you struggle. 

Who is it written for? The real answer is "for myself from a few years ago", but the practical answer is "anyone who thinks like me". I know that's not specific, but if you have ADHD and are following me thus far, you may be one of those people. If you've felt like you're trapped in a cycle of constantly trying new things that inevitably dump you back into the same spot, you may benefit from reading more. 

A note on structure: I’m building this guide as I continue to learn, so consider it a living document. My goal is to keep things in a logical order, but I'm hoping to help folks and be honest that I'm always still learning myself. If you have thoughts, questions, or suggestions, feel free to reach out.

Last thing: there will be a single section about using AI. I feel it can be a good tool, but I understand it's not for everyone, so I specifically wanted to isolate the section so it's easily skippable. I'll keep all AI talks out of the rest of the guide. Also, I wrote this guide by hand, but AI helped find articles and organize my notes (more about this in the AI section). 

Without further ado, let's begin!
## Part 2: Why You Are The Way You Are
Before we get into the major points, it's important to understand the why behind our behavior and why these tactics are necessary. As much as I've always known that ADHD likely had a hand in my struggles, I never realized just how *specific* these symptoms could be.

A crucial disclaimer: I have no medical or mental health background. This is simply what I've come to understand through my own research and experience. Please don’t take this as expert information. I'm summarizing what I've learned and will provide links where possible.
### Executive Dysfunction
A major, *major* challenge with ADHD is executive dysfunction. For those that aren't familiar with the concept; executive functions are the functions that are needed to perform tasks. 

Say you're trying to do the dishes. Executive functions would involve things like ordering the steps within your mind, conceptualizing how long the task will take, shifting focus from removing the dishes in the washer to scrubbing the dishes in the sink to putting the dishes into the washer. 

With these areas impaired, we see that ordering tasks and the actual act of prioritization becomes difficult, recognizing how short the task truly is, and having to remember to keep on-task when shifting from one to another, leads to the feeling of overwhelm.

### Working Memory
People with ADHD don't necessarily struggle with poor memory, but rather poor *working* memory. Think about this as the brain's "RAM", or a sort of temporary scratchpad where quick, short pieces of information which you need to know *right now* is held (like a phone number you're about to call or what you were coming to get in your bedroom). 

People with ADHD typically have less working memory available, and simultaneously often have more to juggle, like trying to remember the prior task, or inexplicably repeating the lyrics to a song over and over. Many of the tactics in this guide are specifically about coping with poor working memory.

### Dopamine Deficit
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a major role in the brain's reward, motivation, and focus systems. For ADHD brains, however, the signaling system is different. The brain struggles with regulation and requirements for dopamine. 

Those with ADHD often find that they feel boredom more acutely than their neurotypical counterparts. While a neurotypical person may feel motivated by the thought of a clean sink or a good night's rest, and experience the dopamine hit that will encourage them to perform what they should do for their benefit, the person with ADHD will be struggling with the lack of dopamine, and find the task insurmountable as a result.

[Cleveland Clinic - Dopamine Deficiency](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22588-dopamine-deficiency)
### Impulse Control
The same brain systems that are involved in executive functions also regulate impulses and emotions. This, alongside the fact that those low on dopamine often experience struggle focusing, impulsive behavior, and mood instability, means that those with ADHD often struggle to regulate themselves emotionally and behaviorally, often called emotional dysregulation. 

While I don't have many direct guides to this right now, my tactic has always been slowing myself down and forcing self-reflection through learning to pump the brakes consciously.

## Major Mindset Shifts
### Metacognition: Learning How to Think About Thinking
For the record, I'm a bit of a skeptic at times, especially when it comes to mental health tactics. I tend to find a lot of them to be... very shallow, unexamined, and maybe even completely wrong. But I've also tried to remind myself there are others out there, who think like me, who _have_ had breakthroughs and run into tactics that are remarkably effective for them.

Which is a long winded way to say: you need to learn how to internalize things.

I thought I knew how to do this for years. I could recite and memorize concepts, but I wasn't actually making them well-understood. The technical term for the skill I was missing is **metacognition**, or "thinking about your thinking." It’s the ability to reflect on how you're consuming information. Are you truly engaging with it, or just letting it wash over you? When you consider a new system, are you applying it to your actual self, or to some imaginary, more capable version of you?

Beyond anything else in this guide, learning to observe your own thoughts and behaviors is possibly the most critical skill.
### Everything is a Skill
A major mindset shift that comes from this is learning to see everything not as a "character flaw," but as a skill you can improve. Don't like how late you sleep in? That's a skill. Is that too broad? Narrow it down: getting out of bed is a skill, and you can get better at it.

I'm living proof. I used to be the person who would lay in bed for hours messing around on my phone. When I started treating it as a skill, the goal wasn't perfection, it was just a tiny bit of improvement. Going from hours to thirty minutes was a win. Now, I'm usually out of bed within ten minutes of my alarm going off. At seven in the morning. It's insane to me, I never imagined I could do this years ago. 

But here’s a crucial part: it was also incredibly slow. Our brains are terrible at calculating slow movement; we aren't built to notice incremental change. That's the paradox- the most transformative progress often happens so gradually that you can't see it day-to-day. You have to look for it on purpose. The good news is that if it’s a skill, you can always get better. You just have to be willing to find and celebrate those impossibly small steps forward (more on giving yourself credit for small steps to come).

## Tackling Difficult Things
### Thinking About It is the First Step
I'll be honest, I hate affirmations, I hate self-talk, and I hate mindfulness. If it works for you, great, but it always feels... strange and unnatural to me. But lately, just lately, some things have started to click, and one of those is acknowledging thoughts. 

Perhaps I'm weird, but I tend to forget thinking takes time and energy. That thinking is an action you need to make room for. It occurred to me that I tended to push away thoughts, and I think (heh) that it's because I associate thought with action. That if I'm thinking about it, I *must* perform the task and therefore I don't want to even consider the thought. Lately, instead, I've been asking myself to see thinking about a task as the first true step. That if I can think about it, with no obligations to get it done, I will give myself a proverbial pat on the back and acknowledge it as progress. 

Often, this makes the task seem much smaller. I find that if, say, I'm avoiding the dishes, I've inflated the idea excessively in my head and, much like the monster in the horror movie that the director hides from sight to further enforce dread, the task you don't see gets imagined as bigger and scarier than it could possibly be. 

Here's what I think now when I think of the dishes: with as neutral a mind as possible, I consider what doing the dishes would entail. Opening the dishwasher, putting the clean dishes away, putting on my dish gloves, running the water, smelling the soap, scrubbing the dishes, putting them in the dishwasher one at a time, and then running the dishwasher. A big, uncomfortable, boring task, sure, but not a monster. Not any more obnoxious than things I get paid to do, and it has some positives to it: I like warm water and I like the smell of the soap. 

And then I may or may not do the dishes. If I do, I congratulate myself. If I don't, I still congratulate myself for running through the simulation. Maybe I feel some disappointment, but I do my best to avoid shame or guilt. If I give myself long enough to think about it, I will often do it eventually. Maybe this won't work for everyone. My wife finds that force *is* what she needs. But, again, this is written for me from a few years ago, and I could've used hearing this earlier. 
### The Dopamenu
I've seen the term "Dopamenu" defined as a list of "stimulating, healthy activities" like exercise or cleaning. To me, those things cause stress; they don't provide a dopamine boost. So, my interpretation is a bit different.

The Dopamenu, for me, is a reward list. It's meant to be a menu of genuinely enjoyable activities that I can always use to reward myself for a job well done. For me they follow two rules: 

- They must be accessible: If the task takes any amount of time or setup, I try to avoid it unless the setup *is* the fun bit
- Genuinely pleasing: I must actually enjoy it on a real, true level, not conceptually.

Then, when I successfully perform (or, sometimes, think about a very difficult task), I'll reward myself to create a positive feedback loop. I'm still learning how to apply this effectively (which, since I haven't said it, is a part of metacognition: learning how to apply things and realizing your first interpretation at a system or methodology may be wrong), and trying to understand how it can make tasks more appealing to engage with them, but it has been effective so far at reinforcing my routine. Which brings me to my next section...
## Creating Consistency Through Routine
I've received great advice about using your routine as an anchor, and it didn't work for me because I had no idea what a routine actually was until recently. I thought they were some mystical thing where you did everything on a schedule. Previously, back in grade school or college, I had a routine enforced by the institutions I was in. School meant I had a place to be for eight hours a day. Parents and then work meant I had structure too. Then, when COVID hit and I graduated college, much of that went away for me. I was left feeling adrift, like every day was a blank, cold slate that had no grounding to it and no instruction. 

So I tried "routines" that I thought were correct, and especially, that fit what I saw routines to be previously. Getting up at certain times, showering at certain times, eating at certain times, working, relaxing, sleeping, etc. I believed a routine was mapping out your day to day life. And maybe you also have many responsibilities and institutions and systems that externally enforce your routine, but COVID effectively dissolved those for me and left me fully to my own devices. And that suddenly left me getting nothing done. I believed that I needed to have hard, strong external factors putting me into a routine by force, or I'd fail.

I am only a short while into this new theory that I was wrong about that. It's very fresh, and I may discover more as time goes on, but I've found that routines aren't meant to be some strict framework to keep you in line. They're meant to work *with* you, bringing you a life you want to live. A routine shouldn't be a scary word, and if it is, which it was for me, it needs some reflection. 
### How to make a routine out of "nothing"
What helped was realizing I _already_ had a routine, even if it didn't look like one. I didn't eat or clean or perform any obvious tasks on a schedule, but I did wake up in the morning for work, and I did consistently have coffee, and I did usually sit on the couch for a while after work on my phone. And I did turn off the lights before bed. All of these were my routine; my foundation for my daily life. And, suddenly, the idea of anchor points made sense: each of these were things I could count on myself doing, so all I had to do was expand them, just a tiny bit. 

The key is that it's tiny though. Want to start journaling every day? Maybe actually doing it is impossible right away. But can you *remember* that you're supposed to journal every day? No shame, no difficulty, view it as your first tiny step (as we discussed before) and see thinking about it as a step, remembering it as a success. 
### Learning to roll with failure
You're going to fall short, especially at first. You need to be easy on yourself. This doesn't just mean "forgiving yourself." It means trying to understand the reasons for the failure and adjusting to make the task as possible as you can.

When I first started, I just wanted to eat breakfast before my first meeting of the day. At first, I couldn't do it. But instead of letting shame set in and giving up, I reframed it as a work in progress. Now, most days, I eat before my first meeting. Am I still falling short sometimes? Absolutely. But I'm still trying, and I'm still getting better.
